                        Hey there! My name is Hunter Robb, and programming is one of my most avid hobbies. I'm a 17 year old student currently attending Lincoln Southwest High School. Alongside programming,
                        I also enjoy playing sports, reading, and listening to music. I'm currently employed at StateStudios, a software-building startup based out of Lincoln, Nebraska, where I have contributed
                        to a wide array of programming and systems-based projects. My time with the company has helped to expand upon what I learned through personal projects, while continuing to build and
                        refine on the set of programming languages I know, which ranges from Java, Javascript, C++, and MySQL, to HTML and CSS.

                        Hey guys! My name is Luther Jensen and computer programming is my passion. I'm currently 17 years old and I go to Lincoln Southwest High School. Some of my favorite pasttimes are
                        computer programming, meeting new people, and playing my favorite Steam games. I work at StateStudios, which is a software startup based in Lincoln, Nebraska and we have a variety
                        of projects. I really love what I do there and I've worked there about a year and a half now! I've learned a lot of languages both through my work, and through my personal projects.
                        I have experience in many languages such as Java, Javascript, C++, Node.JS, and MySQL. I know a few other languages also but these are the major ones that I specialize in.
